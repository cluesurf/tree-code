## Development

Inside the editor, press `F5`. This will compile and run the extension in a new Extension Development Host window. Make changes them press `F5` again, etc..

[Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/extension-anatomy) is more info on building an extension. [Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension) is how to publish the extension.

To publish, get an access token by following [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#get-a-personal-access-token).

- The organization we need to create the access token under is here at [TermSurf](https://dev.azure.com/termsurf).
- Here is the [VSCode Marketplace profile page](https://aex.dev.azure.com/me?mkt=en-US).
- Here is the [VSCode package page for TermSurf](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/termsurf).
